Services out-of-Saskatchewan \u2013 In-Canada Coverage\na) Insured services not available in Saskatchewan should be sought in another province. It is\nimportant for you or your patient to contact the out-of-province provider BEFORE the service is\nreceived to confirm the service is eligible to be billed through the Inter-Provincial Billing\nAgreement (IRBA) otherwise the patient may be responsible for costs.\nb) Most physician and hospital services are billed through IRBA when provided within the publicly\nfunded health care system. Services provided outside of the publicly funded health care system\nare not covered in the IRBA.\nc) Physician services in Quebec may be charged to the patient. Patients can submit a bill to the\nMinistry of Health for consideration of reimbursement at Saskatchewan rates.\nd) Services not fully covered under the IRBA, including some services in Quebec and services\nprovided outside of the publicly funded health care system, may be considered for coverage in\ncertain circumstances for specific conditions when a written request is submitted to the\nMinistry of Health. For coverage, prior approval must be obtained BEFORE the provision of\nservices. A written prior approval request, including costs, must:\n\u2022 be received from a Saskatchewan specialist in the same field of practice as the required\nservice;\n\u2022 describe the circumstances of the case, including why the service(s) are medically required\nand why it must be obtained outside of the province; and,\n\u2022 clearly describe the service(s) being requested, including whether it is available in\nSaskatchewan\n2. Services out-of-Canada \u2013 Limited Coverage\na) Emergency services, or services resulting from an unforeseen or unanticipated medical\nsituation, are limited to payments at Saskatchewan rates. Prior approval is not required.\nb) Non-emergency services, or elective medical services deemed to be pre-arranged, are only\nconsidered for coverage in exceptional circumstances. Prior approval must be obtained from\nthe Ministry of Health in writing BEFORE out-of-Canada services are obtained. Regulations do\nnot permit reimbursement when prior approval is not obtained before services are provided. As\nsuch, to avoid misplaced coverage expectations, it is strongly recommended prior approval is\nobtained before a patient referral is made outside of Canada.\n3. Services Unavailable in Canada \u2013 Prior Approval Coverage:\nWhen an insured service is unavailable in Canada, cost coverage may be considered in exceptional\ncircumstances. All of the following conditions must be met:\na) A Saskatchewan listed specialist, within whose field of practice the required service lies, submits\na written application to the Ministry requesting consideration of coverage BEFORE out-of-\nCanada services are obtained.\nb) The application must state:\n\u2022 the patient's name, address and valid Health Services Number;\n\u2022 pertinent clinical details and diagnosis;\n\u2022 the specific and detailed nature of the service(s) required;\n\u2022 confirmation by the specialist that, to the best of their knowledge, the specific service(s)\nbeing requested is not obtainable within Canada; and,\n\u2022 where possible, the name and location of the physician who is to provide the service.\nApril 1, 2025 Page 9"

Claims for insured services submitted by any mode of billing are subject to the assessment rules \u2013 this\nincludes both in-person and virtual care services. This applies even in the event of claims being received\nunder different modes of billing for services to a patient on the same day.\na) These assessment rules apply to services common to many sections of the Schedule (e.g., visits\nand consultations).\nb) Other rules are listed in the specialty sections.\nc) Assessment rules applying to services listed in only one section of the Schedule are listed as an\nintroduction to the services:\nSection A -- special call services; Section S -- refractions;\nSection H -- anesthesia, intensive care; Section T -- otolaryngology;\nSection J -- surgical assistance; Section V -- laboratory medicine;\nSection M -- fractures, dislocations; Section W -- diagnostic ultrasound;\nSection N -- microvascular surgery; Section X -- radiology, clinical procedures.\nSection P -- obstetrics;\n2. The relationship of the current service to prior or subsequent services may result in payment at an\namount which differs from the payment listed in the Payment Schedule.\n3. A previous payment may be adjusted due to the subsequent submission of a claim for a related service.\n4. Where a claim is returned or the payment is different from the amount billed, an explanatory code, of\ntwo letters e.g. \u201cJO\u201d, is used to indicate the reason. A list of the explanatory codes is to be found at the\nend of this section under the heading \u201cExplanatory Codes\u201d.\n5. When a request is made for an explanation or an outline of circumstances in order to assess a claim, the\nMinistry of Health shall determine whether the explanation is acceptable.\n6. No payment is made for a report or other information required to assess or review an account.\n7. When the words \u201cby report\u201d are shown rather than a specific rate of payment, \u201cby report\u201d means that\nthe claim must be accompanied by a detailed explanation of the circumstances and the services\nprovided. Payment will be assessed on the basis of the explanation.\nVisit Services\nThe assessment rules regarding visit services are applicable to both in-person and virtual care services.\n1. A visit service includes the assessment of one or more conditions during the same patient contact\nwherever the patient may be at the time the service is rendered.\n2. Any claim submitted for a second visit on the same date of service by either the same physician or\nanother in the same clinic and specialty should state the reason for the second visit, the time, location\nand service provided.\n3. The rates of payment for visit services including consultations are those listed in the specialty of the\nphysician providing the service - unless otherwise specified.\n4. A special call or emergency visit by the same physician or another physician in the same specialty and\nclinic billed during a period of in-patient care requires an outline of the circumstances for the visit.\nApril 1, 2025 Page 17"

This includes all other applicable policies and guidelines, which can be found here:\nPolicies Tab Landing Page (cps.sk.ca)\n1. Virtual care is an interaction between patients and/or members of their circle of care, occurring\nremotely, using telephone or secure videoconferencing with the aim of facilitating or maximizing the\nquality and effectiveness of patient care. Remotely, for the purpose of virtual care codes only, is defined\nas without physical contact and does not necessarily involve long distances (unless explicitly stated in\neach service description).\n2. Virtual care service codes are EMR eligible where applicable (i.e. consistent with existing in-person visit\nservice codes). The 875A service code (Limited virtual care visit) is not EMR eligible.\n3. Virtual care service codes are billable by Saskatchewan licensed physicians when both the physician and\nSaskatchewan beneficiary are located in Saskatchewan at the time the virtual care service is provided.\n875A (Limited virtual care visit) may be billed by Saskatchewan physicians and/or Saskatchewan virtual\ncare only clinics that do not provide any in-person services.\na) Virtual care only clinics are virtual care clinics that do not provide in-person physician services.\nb) The Limited virtual care visit service code is payable to physicians providing episodic care\ninitiated by a patient via secure videoconferencing through a virtual care clinic that does not\nprovide in-person physician services.\nc) The Limited virtual care visit service code recognizes that physicians working in virtual care only\nclinics may be providing a patient-initiated single encounter episodic visit.\n4. Unless stated otherwise, virtual care services are not restricted by location within Saskatchewan, i.e.,\npatient and physician may be located anywhere in Saskatchewan. Both the physician and patient must\nbe located in Saskatchewan at the time the service is provided.\n5. Virtual care services are not billable to out-of-province residents or reciprocally by out-of-province\nphysicians. Physicians wishing to provide a virtual care service(s) to an out-of-province resident are\nadvised to contact the resident\u2019s home province to confirm payment.\n6. Virtual care services are not payable to physicians who are concurrently working under salary, service\ncontract, APP or sessional arrangements (i.e. no duplication of payments). Physicians who are\ncompensated by an alternate payment plan (APP), or directly by the Saskatchewan Health Authority\n(SHA) are permitted to \u201cshadow bill\u201d these services, but no payment will be eligible.\n7. Virtual care services are payable to a maximum of 3,000 virtual care services per physician per calendar\nyear (i.e. total sum of telephone and video visits, including limited virtual care visits (875A), cannot\nexceed 3,000 per physician per year, and the total number of limited virtual care visit services (875A)\ncannot exceed 1,500 per physician per year). Note: For time-based virtual care service codes, only the\nbase service code will count towards the annual service count limit.\n8. Virtual care services must be medically required and all time requirements are for direct physician-\npatient interaction in real time.\nApril 1, 2025 Page 20"
