- Removed `aidocs/` from `main`, committed via `cleanup/remove-aidocs-main`
- Protected dev-only docs with `.gitignore` in `main`
- Fast-forwarded `main` to match `origin/main`
- Verified `aidocs/` remains fully intact in `dev`
- Backed up `aidocs/` locally to `~/Desktop/aidocs-temp-backup` (no longer needed)
- Finalized branch structure to retain only `main`, `dev`, and production clone
- Created `sync/prod-to-main` to manage production updates into `main`
- Verified `.gitignore` protects `aidocs/` in `main` and `prod`
- Removed `Source.zip` from repo to clean unnecessary files
- Tested branch-switching behavior with ignored/untracked `aidocs/`
- Cross-verified aidocs/ recovery via screenshots before cleanup
- Synced GitHub to confirm local and remote are fully aligned
- Confirmed with Ben that `MBS.ReconcileClaims` and `SQLDatabaseProj` are obsolete and intentionally removed from production
- Noted Ben‚Äôs offer to re-add them if needed, but agreed to exclude from modernization
- Updated planning docs to reflect their obsolete status
- Conducted research into persistent vector memory systems and dynamic vectorization tools; identified potential solutions for maintaining updated embeddings as project files evolve - need to further study 
- Ran architectural analysis using **Google Jules AI** on the `pmb-dotnet8` repo  
  - Prompt: architectural overview, technical debt, tight coupling  
  - Jules incorrectly flagged `src/` as unused ‚Äî manually verified this was incorrect  
  - Confirmed `src/MedicalBillingSystem.sln` is the authoritative working solution file  
  - No new action items resulted from the AI audit  
  - Created `aidocs/architecture/jules_analysis.md` to store the full summary

- Initial struggles with folder tracking between branches
- `git stash` failed due to already untracked folders
- Used `mv` to manually remove and restore folders
- Validated cleanup strategy using `filter-branch` and enforced `.gitignore` protection
