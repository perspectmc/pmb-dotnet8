## Key Takeaways from Today's Vector Database Work

### üéØ **The Core Discovery**
We discovered that your vector database search issue wasn't actually broken - it was a **semantic mismatch problem**. The database had all your files, but searching for "CLAUDE.md" (a filename) doesn't semantically match the actual content inside the file.

### üí° **What We Learned**

1. **The Real Issue**: 
   - Not a database corruption or indexing failure
   - Simply that `git log --since` only tracks committed files (missed untracked ones)
   - Semantic search treats filenames as meaningless strings unless they're part of the content

2. **The Header Solution Works**:
   - Files with `File: aidocs/path/name.md` headers ARE more searchable
   - But it's not magic - searching for exact headers finds files reliably
   - The enhancement makes filenames "part of the content"

3. **Search Strategies Matter**:
   - Searching for unique content (like "# PMB CODE REVIEW MASTER TRACKER") works perfectly
   - Direct access (`get_file_content()`) is 100% reliable when you know the path
   - Two-step approach (list files ‚Üí access directly) bypasses search entirely

### üîß **Practical Improvements Made**

1. **Diagnosis Tools**: We now understand the difference between storage (working) and search (semantic matching)
2. **Clear Workarounds**: Documented reliable methods to find any file
3. **Living Documentation**: Updated CLAUDE.md will help in every future session

### üöÄ **The Bigger Picture**

This wasn't really a technical failure - it was a **conceptual mismatch** between how we think about search (exact matching) and how semantic search works (meaning-based). Your vector database is actually working great! We just needed to understand its language.

**Bottom line**: You've got a solid system. With the search guide in CLAUDE.md, you'll start each session with clear strategies for finding anything you need. The infrastructure is sound - we just needed better instructions for using it effectively.
## üóìÔ∏è 2025-06-09
- Successfully re-launched local vector database using `ingest_pmb.py` with updated FastAPI server (`vector_api.py`)
- Reconfirmed ingestion of both `/src/` and `/aidocs/` into ChromaDB collection
- Verified live vector server by running two terminals: one for `vector_api.py`, one for `ngrok` tunneling
- Initial queries (e.g., file count, listing paths) returned plausible results via `curl` and `jq`
- However, ChatGPT can no longer access the vector database interactively ‚Äî API calls are blocked or silently fail
- Attempts to run VQ-style prompts through ChatGPT now result in hallucinated or irrelevant responses
- Issue suspected to be misuse of internal filesystem access by ChatGPT; refuses to route all file/folder requests through API as instructed
- No viable workaround discovered during today‚Äôs session; system is stuck in a state where local testing works, but ChatGPT vector access is unreliable
- Pausing vector work until issue is clarified or resolved; may require escalation to CLINE for review

## üóìÔ∏è 2025-06-06
- Removed `aidocs/` from `main`, committed via `cleanup/remove-aidocs-main`
- Protected dev-only docs with `.gitignore` in `main`
- Fast-forwarded `main` to match `origin/main`
- Verified `aidocs/` remains fully intact in `dev`
- Backed up `aidocs/` locally to `~/Desktop/aidocs-temp-backup` (no longer needed)
- Finalized branch structure to retain only `main`, `dev`, and production clone
- Created `sync/prod-to-main` to manage production updates into `main`
- Verified `.gitignore` protects `aidocs/` in `main` and `prod`
- Removed `Source.zip` from repo to clean unnecessary files
- Tested branch-switching behavior with ignored/untracked `aidocs/`
- Cross-verified aidocs/ recovery via screenshots before cleanup
- Synced GitHub to confirm local and remote are fully aligned
- Confirmed with Ben that `MBS.ReconcileClaims` and `SQLDatabaseProj` are obsolete and intentionally removed from production
- Noted Ben‚Äôs offer to re-add them if needed, but agreed to exclude from modernization
- Updated planning docs to reflect their obsolete status
- Conducted research into persistent vector memory systems and dynamic vectorization tools; identified potential solutions for maintaining updated embeddings as project files evolve - need to further study 
- Ran architectural analysis using **Google Jules AI** on the `pmb-dotnet8` repo  
  - Prompt: architectural overview, technical debt, tight coupling  
  - Jules incorrectly flagged `src/` as unused ‚Äî manually verified this was incorrect  
  - Confirmed `src/MedicalBillingSystem.sln` is the authoritative working solution file  
  - No new action items resulted from the AI audit  
  - Created `aidocs/architecture/jules_analysis.md` to store the full summary

## üóìÔ∏è 2025-06-05
- Initial struggles with folder tracking between branches
- `git stash` failed due to already untracked folders
- Used `mv` to manually remove and restore folders
- Validated cleanup strategy using `filter-branch` and enforced `.gitignore` protection
