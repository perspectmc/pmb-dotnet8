No unnecessary complexity added

3. Reference Data Management

Added specific focus on quarterly MSB updates (referring doctors, fee codes)
Automation interfaces to reduce manual pain points
Version control for reference data changes

4. Real-World AI Integration

On-premise/VPS-focused approach
Excel processor as side application
Real-time validation framework (building on hospital number validation pattern)

5. PIPEDA Compliance Focus

# June 7, 2025 v1

Major Additions
1. Architecture Seam Planning (Phase 1.3)

Maps current business logic to future domain boundaries
Identifies AI integration touchpoints early
Designs namespace structure for clean extraction

2. Strategic Project Structure (Phase 2.1.2)

Organizes projects by domain boundaries (PMB.Claims, PMB.BillingRules, etc.)
Sets foundation for future microservice extraction

3. CQRS Foundation (Phase 6)

Entire new phase for business logic refactoring
