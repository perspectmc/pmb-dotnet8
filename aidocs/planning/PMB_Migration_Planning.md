## Migration Strategy: Building Tomorrow's Foundation Today

The key principle: **Build architectural seams during .NET 8 migration that create clean extraction points for future modernization, without over-engineering the current lift-and-shift effort.**

### How Migration Work Enables Future State

| Future Capability | Migration Foundation | Enablement Strategy |
|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **AI Billing Rule Inference** | Policy Rule Engine Abstraction | Extract business rules into dedicated engine with explainable results - AI can plug in as alternative rule processor |
| **Excel-to-Claim AI Parsing** | Document Processing Pipeline | Create pluggable document processor interfaces - AI parsers become new implementations |
| **Physician Trust Scoring** | Event-Driven Architecture + Audit Trail | Domain events capture trust-relevant actions; ML models consume event streams for scoring |
| **API-First Mobile/SPA** | Internal API Controllers | Build API endpoints alongside MVC controllers - frontend becomes consumer of existing APIs |
| **EMR Integration** | Domain Boundary Separation | Clean domain boundaries make integration points obvious; external systems integrate via bounded contexts |
| **Multi-Tenant Architecture** | Configuration Abstraction + Feature Flags | Tenant-aware configuration and feature toggling infrastructure supports client-specific behavior |
| **Advanced Audit/Compliance** | Event Sourcing Foundation | Domain events + audit infrastructure create reconstructable audit trails required for compliance |
| **Microservices Evolution** | Bounded Context Documentation | Clear domain boundaries and dependency abstractions make service extraction straightforward |

# PMB Migration: Future-State Architecture Preparation

## Strategic Seams to Build During .NET 8 Migration

### 1. Domain Boundary Identification & Bounded Context Seams

**Migration Actions → Future Enablement:**
- **Create explicit namespace boundaries** for different business domains
- **Establish domain service interfaces** even if implementations remain coupled
- **Document aggregate boundaries** in code comments for future extraction

**Direct Future Payoff:**
- **Microservices Extraction**: Clean boundaries = clean service boundaries
- **AI Module Integration**: AI services integrate at domain boundaries (e.g., AI billing assistant plugs into Billing.Domain)
- **EMR Integration**: External systems connect through well-defined domain interfaces
- **Team Scalability**: Different teams can own different bounded contexts

**Implementation During Migration:**
```csharp
// Current: Everything in PMB.Web.Controllers
// Migration: Create domain boundaries
PMB.Billing.Domain/     → Future: Billing microservice
PMB.Claims.Domain/      → Future: Claims processing service  
PMB.Physicians.Domain/  → Future: Physician trust service
PMB.Policies.Domain/    → Future: AI policy engine service
```

### 2. Command/Query Separation (CQS) Foundation

**Migration Actions → Future Enablement:**
- **Introduce MediatR pattern** for complex operations (billing rule processing, claim validation)
- **Separate read/write models** for high-volume queries vs. transactional operations
- **Create explicit command/query handler interfaces**

**Direct Future Payoff:**
- **AI Integration**: AI services become command handlers (e.g., `AIBillingRuleProcessor` implements `IBillingRuleProcessor`)
- **Performance Scaling**: Read models can be optimized/cached independently of write operations
- **CQRS Evolution**: Foundation already exists for full CQRS with separate databases
- **Event Sourcing**: Commands naturally produce events for audit/ML training

**Implementation During Migration:**
```csharp
// Current: Controller directly calls repositories
public ActionResult ProcessClaim(ClaimModel model) 
{
    var result = _repository.ProcessClaim(model);
    return View(result);
}

// Migration: Command/Query separation
public async Task<ActionResult> ProcessClaim(ClaimModel model)
{
    var command = new ProcessClaimCommand(model);
    var result = await _mediator.Send(command); // Future: AI handler can process this
    return View(result);
}

// Future: AI plugs in seamlessly
public class AIBillingRuleProcessor : IRequestHandler<ProcessClaimCommand, ClaimResult>
{
    public async Task<ClaimResult> Handle(ProcessClaimCommand request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // AI logic processes the same command structure
    }
}
```

### 3. Document/Content Processing Pipeline

**Migration Actions → Future Enablement:**
- **Abstract file processing behind interfaces** with pluggable implementations
- **Create data extraction pipeline** with validation and error handling
- **Establish audit trail hooks** for all document processing operations

**Direct Future Payoff:**
- **AI Excel Parsing**: AI parser becomes new implementation of `IClaimDataExtractor`
- **OCR Integration**: Document images processed through same pipeline
- **Multiple Input Formats**: PDF, XML, HL7 processors plug into same interface
- **ML Training Data**: All processing results captured for training AI models

**Implementation During Migration:**
```csharp
// Current: Hard-coded Excel processing in controller
public ActionResult UploadClaims(HttpPostedFileBase file)
{
    // Direct Excel processing logic mixed with business logic
}

// Migration: Pluggable processing pipeline
public interface IDocumentProcessor<TInput, TOutput>
{
    Task<ProcessingResult<TOutput>> ProcessAsync(TInput input, ProcessingOptions options);
}

public interface IClaimDataExtractor : IDocumentProcessor<Stream, ClaimData[]> { }

// Future: AI processor plugs in seamlessly
public class AIExcelClaimExtractor : IClaimDataExtractor
{
    public async Task<ProcessingResult<ClaimData[]>> ProcessAsync(Stream excelFile, ProcessingOptions options)
    {
        // AI logic extracts claims from complex Excel formats
        // Returns same ClaimData[] structure as manual processor
    }
}
```

### 4. Policy Engine Architecture Seam

**Migration Actions → Future Enablement:**
- **Extract business rules from controllers/services** into dedicated rule engine classes
- **Create rule metadata storage** (rule descriptions, effective dates, precedence)
- **Implement rule result explanation interface** for transparency and AI training

**Direct Future Payoff:**
- **AI Rule Learning**: Current rule applications become training data for AI models
- **Natural Language Rules**: AI can generate rules from policy documents that plug into same engine
- **Explainable Decisions**: Rule explanations support regulatory compliance and user trust
- **A/B Testing**: Multiple rule engines (human-coded vs AI-generated) can be compared

**Implementation During Migration:**
```csharp
// Current: Business rules scattered in controllers
public ActionResult ValidateClaim(ClaimModel claim)
{
    if (claim.Amount > 1000 && claim.PhysicianTrustScore < 0.7) 
    {
        // Rule logic mixed with presentation logic
    }
}

// Migration: Centralized rule engine
public interface IPolicyRuleEngine
{
    Task<RuleEvaluationResult> EvaluateAsync(Claim claim, PolicyContext context);
}

public class RuleEvaluationResult
{
    public bool IsValid { get; set; }
    public List<RuleViolation> Violations { get; set; }
    public List<RuleExplanation> AppliedRules { get; set; } // Critical for AI training
    public Dictionary<string, object> RuleMetadata { get; set; } // AI feature engineering
}

// Future: AI rule engine implements same interface
public class AIGeneratedRuleEngine : IPolicyRuleEngine
{
    public async Task<RuleEvaluationResult> EvaluateAsync(Claim claim, PolicyContext context)
    {
        // AI-generated rules from policy documents
        // Returns same result structure for consistency
    }
}
```

### 5. Event-Driven Architecture Foundation

**Migration Actions → Future Enablement:**
- **Implement domain events** for all critical business operations
- **Add event publishing infrastructure** (initially synchronous, easily made async)
- **Create event sourcing preparation** for audit-critical entities

**Direct Future Payoff:**
- **AI Training Data**: Event streams provide rich training data for ML models
- **Real-time Notifications**: Events drive immediate alerts and dashboards
- **Audit Reconstruction**: Complete business process reconstruction for compliance
- **Microservice Communication**: Events become integration points between services
- **Physician Trust Scoring**: Trust-relevant events feed ML models for risk assessment

**Implementation During Migration:**
```csharp
// Current: Actions happen without notification
public void UpdatePhysicianTrustFlag(int physicianId, TrustFlag flag)
{
    _repository.UpdateTrustFlag(physicianId, flag);
    // No record of why this happened or what triggered it
}

// Migration: Event-driven approach
public async Task UpdatePhysicianTrustFlag(int physicianId, TrustFlag flag, string reason)
{
    var physician = await _repository.GetPhysicianAsync(physicianId);
    physician.UpdateTrustFlag(flag, reason); // Domain method
    
    await _eventPublisher.PublishAsync(new PhysicianTrustFlagChanged
    {
        PhysicianId = physicianId,
        OldFlag = physician.PreviousTrustFlag,
        NewFlag = flag,
        Reason = reason,
        ChangedBy = _currentUser.Id,
        RelatedClaims = physician.RecentClaims,
        Timestamp = DateTime.UtcNow
    });
}

// Future: AI trust scoring consumes these events
public class AIPhysicianTrustScorer : IEventHandler<PhysicianTrustFlagChanged>
{
    public async Task Handle(PhysicianTrustFlagChanged @event)
    {
        // ML model processes trust flag changes + related claim patterns
        // Updates predictive trust scores
        // Triggers alerts for high-risk patterns
    }
}
```

### 6. API-First Internal Design

**Migration Actions → Future Enablement:**
- **Create internal API controllers** alongside MVC controllers for all major operations
- **Implement consistent response models** with metadata and error handling
- **Add API versioning infrastructure** from day one
- **Implement proper HTTP status code handling** and RESTful design

**Direct Future Payoff:**
- **SPA Frontend**: React/Vue/Angular applications consume existing APIs
- **Mobile Applications**: iOS/Android apps use same APIs as web interface
- **Third-party Integration**: EMR systems integrate via documented APIs
- **Microservices**: Internal APIs become external service contracts
- **AI Integration**: AI services consume and produce data via same API contracts

**Implementation During Migration:**
```csharp
// Current: Only MVC controllers
public class ClaimsController : Controller
{
    public ActionResult SubmitClaim(ClaimModel model)
    {
        // Returns HTML view
    }
}

// Migration: Parallel API controllers
[ApiController]
[Route("api/v1/claims")]
public class ClaimsApiController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpPost]
    public async Task<ApiResponse<ClaimResult>> SubmitClaim([FromBody] SubmitClaimRequest request)
    {
        // Same business logic, different presentation
        return new ApiResponse<ClaimResult>
        {
            Data = result,
            Messages = validationMessages,
            Metadata = new ApiMetadata
            {
                ProcessingTime = stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds,
                Version = "1.0",
                CorrelationId = HttpContext.TraceIdentifier
            }
        };
    }
}

// Future: SPA frontend consumes this API
const claimResult = await fetch('/api/v1/claims', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(claimData)
});

// Future: Mobile app uses same API
// Future: AI services post processed claims to same endpoint
```

## Data Model Strategic Decisions

### 1. Audit & Temporal Data Strategy

**Migration Phase Implementation:**
- **Add audit fields to all entities** (CreatedBy, CreatedAt, ModifiedBy, ModifiedAt)
- **Implement soft delete pattern** with DeletedAt, DeletedBy fields
- **Create audit log table structure** for change tracking
- **Add correlation IDs** for request tracing

**Database Changes:**
```sql
-- Add to all tables
ALTER TABLE [TableName] ADD 
    CreatedAt DATETIME2 NOT NULL DEFAULT GETUTCDATE(),
    CreatedBy NVARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    ModifiedAt DATETIME2,
    ModifiedBy NVARCHAR(100),
    DeletedAt DATETIME2,
    DeletedBy NVARCHAR(100),
    CorrelationId UNIQUEIDENTIFIER;
```

### 2. Physician Trust & Registry Architecture

**Migration Phase Preparation:**
- **Separate physician identity from trust scoring:**
  ```
  Physicians (identity data)
  PhysicianTrustProfiles (trust metrics, flags, history)
  PhysicianCredentials (licenses, certifications)
  ```
- **Create trust score calculation interfaces** for future ML integration
- **Add trust event logging** (trust changes, flag reasons, appeals)

### 3. Flexible Configuration & Feature Flags

**Migration Phase Implementation:**
- **Create feature flag infrastructure:**
  ```csharp
  public interface IFeatureManager
  {
      bool IsEnabled(string feature, string context = null);
      T GetConfiguration<T>(string key, T defaultValue = default);
  }
  ```
- **Add tenant/client-specific configuration** support
- **Implement A/B testing hooks** for AI feature rollouts

## Clean Architecture Preparation Strategies

### 1. Dependency Inversion Seams

**Action Items for Migration:**
- **Create abstraction layers** for all external dependencies:
  - `IEmailService`, `IFileStorageService`, `IPdfGenerator`
  - `IBillingSystemIntegration`, `IInsuranceProviderApi`
- **Implement repository pattern** properly (not just EF wrappers)
- **Add unit of work pattern** for complex transactions

### 2. Application Service Layer Definition

**Create explicit application services** that orchestrate domain operations:
```csharp
public class BillingApplicationService
{
    // Orchestrates domain objects, handles transactions, publishes events
    public async Task<ClaimResult> SubmitClaimAsync(SubmitClaimRequest request)
    {
        // 1. Validate request
        // 2. Apply business rules
        // 3. Persist changes
        // 4. Publish events
        // 5. Return result
    }
}
```

### 3. Domain Model Protection

**Migration Phase Actions:**
- **Keep domain entities free** of infrastructure concerns (no EF attributes in domain classes)
- **Create explicit mapping layers** between domain and persistence models
- **Implement domain validation** separate from MVC model validation

## Documentation & Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

### Create ADRs for:
1. **Domain Boundary Decisions** - Why certain features are grouped together
2. **Event Design Patterns** - How domain events will be structured
3. **API Design Standards** - Consistent patterns for future API development
4. **Security Architecture** - Token strategies, audit patterns, data protection
5. **Integration Patterns** - How external systems will be integrated

### Future Refactoring Roadmap Documentation

**Create a "Phase 2 Extraction Guide":**
- **Bounded Context Extraction Order** - Which domains to extract first
- **Data Migration Strategies** - How to split databases without downtime
- **API Contract Evolution** - How to maintain backward compatibility
