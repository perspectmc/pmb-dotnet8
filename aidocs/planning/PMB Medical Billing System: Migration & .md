### Migration Strategy: Building Tomorrow's Foundation Today
The key principle: Build architectural seams during .NET 8 migration that create clean extraction points for future modernization, without over-engineering the current lift-and-shift effort.
PMB Migration: Future-State Architecture Preparation
Strategic Seams to Build During .NET 8 Migration
1. Domain Boundary Identification & Bounded Context Seams
Current Migration Phase Actions:

Create explicit namespace boundaries for different business domains:
PMB.Billing.Domain/
PMB.Claims.Domain/
PMB.Physicians.Domain/
PMB.Patients.Domain/
PMB.Policies.Domain/
PMB.Audit.Domain/

Establish domain service interfaces even if implementations remain coupled
Document aggregate boundaries in code comments for future extraction

### Future Payoff: Clean microservice extraction, AI module integration points, separate deployment units
2. Command/Query Separation (CQS) Foundation
Current Migration Phase Actions:

Introduce MediatR pattern for complex operations (billing rule processing, claim validation)
Separate read/write models for high-volume queries vs. transactional operations
Create explicit command/query handler interfaces

### Example Seam:
csharppublic interface IBillingRuleProcessor
{
    Task<RuleValidationResult> ProcessClaimAsync(ProcessClaimCommand command);
    Task<PolicyRuleSet> GetApplicableRulesAsync(GetRulesQuery query);
}
Future Payoff: AI rule inference engines can plug in as command handlers, read optimization, CQRS evolution
3. Document/Content Processing Pipeline
Current Migration Phase Actions:

Abstract file processing behind interfaces:
csharppublic interface IDocumentProcessor<TInput, TOutput>
{
    Task<TOutput> ProcessAsync(TInput input, ProcessingOptions options);
}

public interface IClaimDataExtractor : IDocumentProcessor<Stream, ClaimData> { }

Create pluggable validation pipeline for extracted data
Establish audit trail hooks for all document processing

Future Payoff: AI-powered Excel parsing, OCR integration, multiple input formats, ML training data collection
4. Policy Engine Architecture Seam
Current Migration Phase Actions:

Extract business rules from controllers/services into dedicated rule engine classes
Create rule metadata storage (rule descriptions, effective dates, precedence)
Implement rule result explanation interface for transparency

Example Structure:
csharppublic interface IPolicyRuleEngine
{
    Task<RuleEvaluationResult> EvaluateAsync(Claim claim, PolicyContext context);
}

public class RuleEvaluationResult
{
    public bool IsValid { get; set; }
    public List<RuleViolation> Violations { get; set; }
    public List<RuleExplanation> AppliedRules { get; set; } // For AI training
}
Future Payoff: AI rule learning, natural language rule generation, explainable billing decisions
5. Event-Driven Architecture Foundation
Current Migration Phase Actions:

Implement domain events for critical business operations:

ClaimSubmitted
BillingRuleApplied
PhysicianTrustFlagChanged
PolicyUpdated


Add event publishing infrastructure (even if initially synchronous)
Create event sourcing preparation for audit-critical entities

Future Payoff: Real-time notifications, audit reconstruction, AI training event streams, microservice communication
6. API-First Internal Design
Current Migration Phase Actions:

Create internal API controllers alongside MVC controllers for all major operations
Implement consistent response models:
csharppublic class ApiResponse<T>
{
    public T Data { get; set; }
    public List<string> Messages { get; set; }
    public ApiMetadata Metadata { get; set; } // Pagination, timing, etc.
}

Add API versioning infrastructure from day one
Implement proper HTTP status code handling

Future Payoff: SPA frontend ready, mobile API ready, third-party integrations, API-first mindset
Data Model Strategic Decisions
1. Audit & Temporal Data Strategy
Migration Phase Implementation:

Add audit fields to all entities (CreatedBy, CreatedAt, ModifiedBy, ModifiedAt)
Implement soft delete pattern with DeletedAt, DeletedBy fields
Create audit log table structure for change tracking
Add correlation IDs for request tracing

Database Changes:
sql-- Add to all tables
ALTER TABLE [TableName] ADD 
    CreatedAt DATETIME2 NOT NULL DEFAULT GETUTCDATE(),
    CreatedBy NVARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    ModifiedAt DATETIME2,
    ModifiedBy NVARCHAR(100),
    DeletedAt DATETIME2,
    DeletedBy NVARCHAR(100),
    CorrelationId UNIQUEIDENTIFIER;
2. Physician Trust & Registry Architecture
Migration Phase Preparation:

Separate physician identity from trust scoring:
Physicians (identity data)
PhysicianTrustProfiles (trust metrics, flags, history)
PhysicianCredentials (licenses, certifications)

Create trust score calculation interfaces for future ML integration
Add trust event logging (trust changes, flag reasons, appeals)

3. Flexible Configuration & Feature Flags
Migration Phase Implementation:

Create feature flag infrastructure:
csharppublic interface IFeatureManager
{
    bool IsEnabled(string feature, string context = null);
    T GetConfiguration<T>(string key, T defaultValue = default);
}

Add tenant/client-specific configuration support
Implement A/B testing hooks for AI feature rollouts

Clean Architecture Preparation Strategies
1. Dependency Inversion Seams
Action Items for Migration:

Create abstraction layers for all external dependencies:

IEmailService, IFileStorageService, IPdfGenerator
IBillingSystemIntegration, IInsuranceProviderApi


Implement repository pattern properly (not just EF wrappers)
Add unit of work pattern for complex transactions

2. Application Service Layer Definition
Create explicit application services that orchestrate domain operations:
csharppublic class BillingApplicationService
{
    // Orchestrates domain objects, handles transactions, publishes events
    public async Task<ClaimResult> SubmitClaimAsync(SubmitClaimRequest request)
    {
        // 1. Validate request
        // 2. Apply business rules
        // 3. Persist changes
        // 4. Publish events
        // 5. Return result
    }
}
3. Domain Model Protection
Migration Phase Actions:

Keep domain entities free of infrastructure concerns (no EF attributes in domain classes)
Create explicit mapping layers between domain and persistence models
Implement domain validation separate from MVC model validation

Documentation & Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
Create ADRs for:

Domain Boundary Decisions - Why certain features are grouped together
Event Design Patterns - How domain events will be structured
API Design Standards - Consistent patterns for future API development
Security Architecture - Token strategies, audit patterns, data protection
Integration Patterns - How external systems will be integrated

Future Refactoring Roadmap Documentation
Create a "Phase 2 Extraction Guide":

Bounded Context Extraction Order - Which domains to extract first
Data Migration Strategies - How to split databases without downtime
API Contract Evolution - How to maintain backward compatibility
Testing Strategy Evolution - How to maintain test coverage during extraction

Immediate Action Items for WBS Integration
Add to Phase 2 (Core Platform Migration):

 2.4 Domain Boundary Definition

 Create domain namespace structure
 Define aggregate boundaries in documentation
 Establish domain service interfaces



Add to Phase 3 (Data Access):

 3.3 Audit Infrastructure Implementation

 Add audit fields to all entities
 Implement soft delete pattern
 Create correlation ID tracking



Add to Phase 4 (UI & Frontend):

 4.3 API Controller Creation

 Create parallel API controllers for major operations
 Implement consistent API response models
 Add API versioning infrastructure



Add to Phase 5 (Security):

 5.3 Event Infrastructure Preparation

 Implement domain event publishing
 Create audit event logging
 Add feature flag infrastructure



New Phase Addition - Phase 6.5: Architecture Documentation

 6.5.1 Create Architectural Decision Records
 6.5.2 Document domain boundaries and future extraction points
 6.5.3 Create Phase 2 refactoring roadmap
 6.5.4 Establish integration patterns documentation

Success Metrics for Future-Readiness

 Event Infrastructure: All major business operations publish events
 API Readiness: All CRUD operations available via API endpoints
 Audit Completeness: All data changes are fully auditable
 Feature Flag Coverage: New features can be toggled without deployment
 Clean Dependencies: No circular dependencies between domain layers
 Integration Seams: External systems accessed only through abstractions

This foundation will make your Phase 2 modernization dramatically easier while keeping the migration focused and achievable.
