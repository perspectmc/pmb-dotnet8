FILE: EnumTypes.cs (Foundation File - Business Workflow States)
BUSINESS PURPOSE: 
Defines the "states" and "categories" that drive the entire medical billing workflow.
When doctors see claim statuses in the dashboard or generate reports, these enums 
determine what options they have and what the system displays.

CORE BUSINESS WORKFLOW:
1. Doctor enters claims (Unsubmitted) → Hits submit → API to MSB (Submitted)
2. MSB processes claims → Returns: Paid (with payment) | Rejected (with codes) | Pending (under review)
3. System displays status to doctors using SearchClaimType enum values
4. Doctors generate reports using ReportType enum options
5. WCB claims follow separate workflow using ClaimType.WCB

KEY COMPONENTS:
- SearchClaimType enum: Claim lifecycle states (Unsubmitted→Submitted→Pending→Paid/Rejected)
- ReportType enum: Business report categories (Paid, Rejected, UnitRecord combinations)
- ClaimType enum: Insurance provider routing (MSB=Medical Services Branch, WCB=Workers Comp)
- DeliverStatus enum: External delivery tracking (WCB fax system integration)
- ClaimsInType enum: Return file processing categories

UPSTREAM DEPENDENCIES (Files that use this):
- ServiceRecordController.cs (UI state management, claim filtering)
- ServiceRecordRepository.cs (database queries by claim status)
- ClaimsReportCreator.cs (report generation using ReportType)
- FeedbackController.cs (WCB delivery status tracking)
- Multiple service classes (search and filtering operations)

DOWNSTREAM DEPENDENCIES (What this file uses):
- System.Web (basic web framework)
- No dependencies on other MBS files

BUSINESS IMPACT: HIGH - OPERATIONAL CRITICAL
- If broken: Dashboard shows wrong claim counts, reports fail, search broken
- Revenue impact: Doctors can't track claim status or generate required reports
- User experience: UI becomes unusable for claim management
- Data integrity: Status transitions could fail or display incorrectly

MIGRATION ACTIONS NEEDED (.NET Framework → .NET 8):
- [ ] Verify integer enum values preserved exactly in database storage
- [ ] Test SearchClaimType filtering in UI after EF6→EF Core migration
- [ ] Validate ReportType enum usage in report generation services
- [ ] Confirm ClaimType routing logic works with .NET 8 HTTP clients
- [ ] Test DeliverStatus integration with Interfax WCB fax service

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS RECOMMENDED:
- [ ] Consider adding audit trail for claim status transitions
- [ ] Evaluate adding more granular pending states (MSB processing vs technical issues)
- [ ] Add enum for priority levels (routine vs urgent claims)

MIGRATION PRIORITY: High (Foundation file - UI and business logic depend on these)
COMPLEXITY LEVEL: Low (Simple enum definitions, stable values)
AI ANALYSIS CONFIDENCE: High (Complete file analysis, business workflow verified, production system confirmed working)

VERIFIED BUSINESS CONTEXT:
- Production system "works wonderful right now" with current enum design
- UI dashboard displays exact enum states in claim summary
- Mixed integer/string storage pattern is by design (internal logic vs external APIs)
- Known data sync issues are business process problems, not migration risks
- Enum integer values (0-5) are stored in database and must be preserved exactly

RESEARCH VERIFIED:
- .NET Framework → .NET 8 migration does not change enum integer values
- EF6 → EF Core maintains backward compatibility for enum storage
- No breaking changes found in Microsoft documentation for enum handling
